Oooh, turns out, this **MACHINE_IP** machine is also a DNS server! If we could dig into it, I am sure we could find some interesting records! But... it seems weird, this only responds to a special type of request for a givemetheflag.com domain?



Access this challenge by deploying both the vulnerable machine by pressing the green "Start Machine" button located within this task, and the TryHackMe AttackBox by pressing the  "Start AttackBox" button located at the top-right of the page.

Use some common DNS enumeration tools installed on the AttackBox to get the DNS server on **MACHINE_IP** to respond with the flag.
